<h2>Tia Chuy's Story</h2>
<img src="tiachuy.jpg" alt="Cookies" class="center" style="width: 25%">
<p>Tia Chuy began her cookie empire when she bit into a delicious dulce de leche filled sandwich cookie coated in powdered sugar known as an alfajor. She immediately thought, "I can make a better cookie."
<br>
<br>
After looking over some family recipes and after a few months of experimenting, she perfected the now famous mini-alfajor and her Mexican wedding cookies. 
<br>
<br>
After taking one bite of Tia Chuy's Kookies, family and friends were hooked and the orders started pouring in and cookie sales skyroceted!</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>In addition to her delicious cookies, Tia Chuy now offers orange loaves and coffee cakes. Explore our website to learn more about our baked goods and contact us to place an order.</p>
